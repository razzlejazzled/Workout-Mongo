# Workout-Mongo

For this App, I was asked to use a Mongo database, Mongoose schema, and express. Some client-side code was provided, as was the user story. 
In addition to Mongo, Mongoose, and Express, Morgan and path are employed, and the site is deployed on Heroku via mongodb Atlas.

## User Story (Provided to me)

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

The site can be [viewed here](https://tranquil-reaches-02659.herokuapp.com/?id=5f6ea4d35f0b560017ab71dc)
